# Udacity Professional Profile Review
## What are Profiles?
A Udacity Professional Profile is your direct connection to Udacity's hiring partners. 
Our Employer Partnerships team uses Profiles to help hiring partners search for candidates like yourself 
to fill a plethora of positions ranging from short-term, contract opportunities to full-time jobs.

## How Can I Make Myself Visible to Employers?
You can enable your Profile's private/public access. 
In this course, we'll go over how to optimize your Profile for search to attract the right employers.

## Enable public profile
## Search or ask questions in Knowledge.
## Ask peers or mentors for help in Student Hub.
