## QUIZ QUESTION
Look at your TODOs. This is going to look a lot like what we did to add that menu to the Github query app earlier.

Add a "Refresh" string named action_refresh

Create a new "forecast" menu with a single "Refresh" menu item

Inflate the menu on onCreateOptionsMenu

Handle the menu action in onOptionsItemSelected by clearing the weatherTextView and calling loadWeatherData
