# My VidNotes:
Gradle wrapper = just shell scripts
- gradlew for Mac/Linux
- gradlew.bat for Windows

To run the gradle shell script, type at the command line
- ./gradlew 
- ./gradlew tasks
- ./gradlew hello

When using the command line, you have to explicity tell Gradle that you want it to run in the background (i.e. daemon).
You want it to run in the background (daemon), so that you can still execute your main work in the foreground.


# Udacity Notes:
Actually, since Gradle 3.0, the daemon is enabled by default! Woo hoo!

Note that all code shown in this course is available from the course GitHub repository. The code for this demo is in the 1.01-Exercise-RunYourFirstTask folder.

We'll learn more about the Gradle wrapper in lesson 2, but you can check out this chapter of the Gradle User Guide for more info.

You can learn more about the Gradle daemon in this chapter of the Gradle User Guide.
