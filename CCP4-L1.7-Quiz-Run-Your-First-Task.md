To run your first task, download the course code from the repository here, or you can just clone from: https://github.com/udacity/ud867.git.

Then follow the instructions in the build.gradle file in the 1.01-Exercise-RunYourFirstTask folder. Remember that you can always find help in the solution.gradle file in the same folder!
